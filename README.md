# Rock-Paper-Scissors

*Steps to implement the game in Python Language*

1. we need to give player name as input

2. we will ask how many rounds would you like to play?
    3 / 5 / 7 / 9 (This is should be an odd number)
    So we can derive a winner
   There are two rules to give the input as rounds
   Rule-1: the input should be an Odd Number
   Rule-2: it should be greater than 2 and less than 10
   if these two rules are not satisfied ask again

4. Make a function to generate random computer input
    (Rock Paper Scissor)

5. Make a function to take player input of
    R = Rock, P = Paper, S = Scissor

6. Check who is winning in a specific round

7. Record the Score of the game

8. Repeat everything until there is a winner
